            <p class="card-text">The history books will laud Messi,
                and yet their limitations will do him a disservice.
                In 20 years, young football fans will read about a
                messianic figure whose brilliance stunned the world,
                shattered a litany of records and started an era of
                dominance… but not until they watch the videos will
                they get an idea of what they have missed.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">2. Pele</h5>
            <p class="card-text">At the age of 17, in 1958, Pele became
                the youngest player to feature in a World Cup final.
                He scored six times in Sweden, including a semi-final
                hat-trick and two more in the final. It was to be the
                first of three World Cup trophies he brought back home
                as an answer to those tears he saw running down his
                dad’s face.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">3. Maradonna</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Longevity, goals and trophies are where Lionel Messi and
                Pele arguably have the slight edge but, boy, Maradona was
                exciting. The Argentine was the rebel who produced possibly
                the most iconic individual goal ever scored, on the way to
                maybe the greatest World Cup triumph of all in 1986. A man
                who’s been deified in both his homeland and the Italian city
                of Naples.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">4. Cristiano Ronaldo</h5>
            <p class="card-text">When Ronaldo became the first player ever
                to score in five World Cups, two days after Argentina opened
                their 2022 campaign with a shock defeat to Saudi Arabia, he
                hoped it would be the start of his bid to stand above Lionel
                Messi forever. Instead, things unravelled irreparably in just
                a few weeks.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">5. Johan Cruyff</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Two months after making his first-team debut,
                Cruyff met former PE teacher Rinus Michels. Together, the pair
                invented Total Football. Wingers and overlapping full-backs kept
                the pitch wide, defenders were encouraged to bring the ball out
                from the back (if a midfielder dropped to cover the space) and
                the centre-forward – usually Cruyff – could roam free as Michels’
                on-field conductor.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">6. Zinedine Zidane</h5>
            <p class="card-text">There's a common conception in football that the
                most creative talents also tend to be the least efficient; that
                style comes at the expense of steel. It’s what constitutes the idea
                of the luxury player. Zidane was the most luxurious player possible
                and yet combined it with towering levels of competitive resolve: a
                heady cocktail of technique, grace, competitiveness and the uncanny
                ability to pick his moments with aplomb.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">7. Franz Beckenbauer</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Like many great players, Beckenbauer was adept at
                playing in several positions. Originally a centre-forward, he
                actually made his Bayern debut in the Regionalliga Sud as a left
                winger, and in his first full season, Bayern won promotion to the
                recently formed Bundesliga. As Bayern’s youth team products blossomed,
                Bayern gradually became the dominant force in West German football.</p>
